# Random Trivia

Random Trivia is an interactive front-end site that provides the user with a fun trivia game that allows users to select a username and select trivia questions from 3 different categories, while keeping score of how many questions were answered correctly and incorectly and dispalying a final result at the end of a game.

The site will be useful by providing users with an interactive, intertaining and fun trivia game that is responsive to all their devices and allows them to actively engage with the data while keeping track of their results.

The site owner's goal is to provide a challenging, fun and entertaining quiz to their online users.

## Conception

- I made use of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create a wireframe concept for Random Trivia.
- I found it challenging to conceptualize the complete design of the site, concerning how capable I am with Javascript and what I could accomplish within the given amount of time, therfore the main design of the page has changed as I progressed through the development towards a finished product.

### Landing Page

- I tried to design a simple yet effective landing page which efficiently and clearly describes the site's purpose, containg a button to trigger the intiation of the game.

![Wireframe Landing Page](/assets/images/balsamiq-landing-page.png)


### Username Entry

- A simple and clean username entry after the user decides to initiate the game, with a button to confirm entry once the user has entered a username.

![Wireframe Enter Username](/assets/images/balsamiq-username.png)


### Welcome Page

- Initially I thought that I would add an additional welcome page after the user entered a username, but deicided against this in the final product as I believe that is was unnecessary and had no valuable purpose.
- Instead in the final product I decided to create a function where the user has the option to confirm or edit their username after previewing it.

### Question Display

- I designed a simple question layout with a clear objective.

### Answer Feedback

- I also knew that I wanted some way of providing the user with feedback after selecting an answer, whether the user was correct or not.

### End of Quiz summary

- At the end of the quiz I wanted the user to receive some form of feedback giving them a summary of their achievements.

  ![NoUsername was provided](assets/images/no-username-alert.png)

  - Once the "Done" button is clicked, it will trigger a function to provide the user a preview of their username and ask the user if they would confirm their username or re-enter a new one.
  - If the "Re-enter" button is clicked then the user will be taken back to the screen with the text input in order to re-enter a new username.
  - If the user clicks the "Confirm" button then the user will be taken to the select topic screen.

  ![Choose Topic](assets/images/choose-topic-screenshot.png)

  - This section will display a question and provide the user with four possible answers.
  - This section also displays the user's username and indicates how many questions have been answered correctly or incorrectly.
  - There is a clearly marked button where the user can click in order to check their answer.

### Features Left to Implement

- __Difficulty Selector__

  - In future with the addition of more questions, one good provide the users with a difficulty selector after the user has chosen their topic.

- __Multiple Players__

  - I would also think that a good future feature to add would be to give the user the ability to add other users to the game, track their idividual scores and have a player ranking at the end of the game.

- __Custom Questions__

  - I would also suggest in future to give the user the functionality to be able to create their own quiz.

## Testing

- I made extensive use of Chrome Developer Tools, the "debugger" keyword and the alert function while developing and testing Random Trivia, from inception to completion.
  - I got into the habit of using the alert function to test all event listeners and functions in order to see if they were behaving as I had intended.
  - If an issue was found, then I would place the "debugger" keyword in the script and make use of Chrome Developer Tools in order to track the entire process and find my logical error.
- Found bug with the username input page, if the user pressed the enter key after using the text input, then the site would try and submit the form, which displayed a 501 Error code.
  - **Not Resolved**
- Found bug with answer incrementation, the site would not display the final score increment.
  - **Resolved** by creating the correct answer, incorrect answer and end of game functions, in order to track the score and display a correct final score to the user ant the end of a game.
- Sourced most common media breakpoint widths on [www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-media-queries-breakpoints-media-types-standard-resolutions-and-more/.) and made the site responsive down to minimum width of 320 pixels.
  - Mobile devices: 320px — 480px
  - iPads, Tablets: 481px — 768px
  - Small screens, laptops: 769px — 1024px
  - Desktops, large screens: 1025px — 1200px
  - Extra large screens, TV: 1201px and more
- Made use of Chrome developer tools for previewing and testing new designs for media queries as well as UX aspects.

### Validator Testing

- Made use of the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for the CSS file, the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for the HTML file and [Jshint.com](https://jshint.com/) for all the necessary validator testing.
